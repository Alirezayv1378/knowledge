# Experience

1. When you creating a new project or working on a new feature, the most important thing is first to **create something that just works**. Then you can improve it and make it better. Don't waste time on something perfect that dosen't work, just make it work.

2. Set deadlines for yourself. I wasn't very good at calculating how much time I need for a task, so a good way to do it is guess how much time it will take and then multiply it by a factor of 1.5 or 2.
