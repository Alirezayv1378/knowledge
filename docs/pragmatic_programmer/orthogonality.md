# Meaning
- In math two lines or orthogonal if the meet at right angles, for example x and y axes or orthogonal.
- In programming it means separating every module from each other and remove dependencies and decoupling from code.
- example: Helicopter control system is not orthogonal.
- In an orthogonal system writing unit tests is very easy because each function do just one thing and separated from other modules and functions.
- using global variables is a sign of nonorthogonal system.
- Avoid similar functions. if two functions are share same code overall but each one has different central algorithm, try [[strategy|strategy pattern]] from design patterns.
