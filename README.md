# Learning and Documentation Project

## Introduction
This project is designed to organize notes, data, and code I collect during my learning journey and project work. The goal is to keep everything tidy and accessible, so I can easily refer back to it or share it with others.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows to ensure clarity and ease of use:

- **`/docs`**: Contains documentation and notes
  - `/notes`: Learning notes in Markdown format
  - `/tutorials`: Detailed tutorials or guides
  - `README.md`: Overview of the documentation
- **`/data`**: Stores datasets
  - `/raw`: Raw data files like CSV or JSON
  - `/processed`: Processed data files
  - `/metadata`: Metadata descriptions for datasets
- **`/src`**: Project code
  - `/scripts`: Standalone scripts (e.g., Python)
  - `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks
  - `/utils`: Helper functions or utilities
- **`/assets`**: Multimedia files
  - `/images`: Images used in documentation
  - `/figures`: Generated charts or figures
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files to ignore in Git
- **`LICENSE`**: Project license (e.g., MIT)

## How to Use
1. **Notes**: Add new notes to `/docs/notes` using Markdown format.
2. **Data**: Store raw data in `/data/raw` and processed data in `/data/processed`. Write metadata descriptions in `/data/metadata`.
3. **Code**: Place scripts in `/src/scripts` and Jupyter notebooks in `/src/notebooks`.
4. **Images and Figures**: Save documentation images in `/assets/images` and generated charts in `/assets/figures`.
5. **Updates**: Commit changes with `git commit` and push to GitHub.

## Prerequisites
- For code: Python 3.x or any other programming language you use.
- For documentation: Any Markdown editor (e.g., VS Code or Obsidian).
- For data: Tools like Pandas for handling CSV or JSON files.

## Important Notes
- **Naming**: Use meaningful English names for files and folders to make the project understandable to others.
- **Large Data**: For large datasets, use Git LFS or cloud services like Google Drive instead of direct uploads.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep notes and code updated to stay current.
- **License**: The project license (e.g., MIT) defines how others can use the project.
